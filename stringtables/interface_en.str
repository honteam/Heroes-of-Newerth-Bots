loading_tiptitle				Game Hint
loading_tip1					Holding ^gCONTROL^* while using the shop will display recipe scrolls instead of the item, allowing you to quickly purchase the recipe.
loading_tip2					While using an ability, you can hold ^gSHIFT^* and select another ability to put it in your ability queue. As soon as the first ability has completed the next ability will fire immediately after.
loading_tip3					You can attack your own creeps when they are low health. If you kill them it results in a "deny" and surrounding enemies get much less experience than they would normally.
loading_tip4					If you attack your tower when it is low and destroy it, the enemy team gets much less gold than if they had destroyed it themselves.
loading_tip5					Typing /matchup or /ma in-game will print a list of all the players, heroes, levels, and player colors.
loading_tip6					You can sell an item from your stash by holding ^gSHIFT^* and ^gCONTROL^* when ^gRIGHT ^gCLICKING^* an item.
loading_tip7					You can quickly transfer an item between your stash and inventory by holding ^gCONTROL^* and ^gRIGHT ^gCLICKING^* the item.
loading_tip8					Lost track of where your hero is? Tapping the ^gC^* key will center the screen on your hero.
loading_tip9					Magic Armor reduces the damage you take from Magic damage, but doesn't provide any protection against physical attacks or abilities.
loading_tip10					Try to always have at least one Homecoming Stone. You never know when you'll need to help defend the other side of the map or use it to avoid being ganked.
loading_tip11					Holding ground (^gH^* by default) will stop your hero from attacking or moving, allowing you to time last hits with more precision.
loading_tip12					You can quickly share control of a courier with other players by clicking the small arrows above their pictures on the left side of the screen.
loading_tip13					Wards of Sight are an inexpensive way to gain a large advantage over opponents by watching where they go and who they are with.
loading_tip14					In the beginning of the game, never leave the base without a way to heal yourself.
loading_tip15 					Kongor respawns 10 minutes after he is killed and reclaims the Token of Life if it has not been used after 7 minutes.
loading_tip16					Kongor drops the Token of Life when killed. The Token resurrects the holder instantly when they die, but is consumed in the process.
loading_tip17					Fear the Chiprel!
loading_tip18					A special powerup spawns every two minutes in the river and can grant you movement speed, invisibility, regeneration, double damage, or illusions.
loading_tip19					Neutral creeps respawn every minute as long as nothing is nearby. 
loading_tip20					You can sell back an item for a full refund as long as it is within 15 seconds of when you bought it.
loading_tip21					The commands /ignorechat or /ic can be used to quickly ignore various forms of in-game chat.
loading_tip22					At the beginning of a match you can't take much damage so try to play defensive and stay behind your creeps, avoiding as much damage as possible.
loading_tip23					When the opposing team has heroes with invisibility, use Dust of Revelation, Wards of Revelation, or a Bound Eye to reveal them.
loading_tip24					Recipes are not useful on their own, you need all of the components before they will do anything for you.
loading_tip25					In the early game, if an enemy hero in your lane goes missing suddenly, be sure to let your team know. It can prevent them from being unexpectedly killed.
loading_tip26					Teamwork is essential to win. If you find yourself getting killed a lot while alone, stick with some allies. 
loading_tip27					Watch the Minimap. It is a great tool for keeping an eye on your enemies position. Be careful for missing enemy heroes or allies coming to help you kill in your lane.
loading_tip28					Communication is important. Talk to your team, call for help, and listen to other players when they call a hero missing. 
loading_tip29					To ping the minimap and alert your team, hold ^gALT^* and click an area! 
loading_tip30					There is more than one way to play a hero. Try picking different items you might not normally use.
loading_tip31					Couriers cannot be used to fill up bottles from the fountain.
loading_tip32					Attacking enemy heroes when they are focusing on your teammate (and therefore ignoring you) can often turn a bad situation around. Use the opponents distraction to your advantage.
loading_tip33					There are lots of places you can enter the trees to hide or take shortcuts. Learning where these are will greatly increase your survival chances.
loading_tip34					When you read "Superior Magic" in a skill description, it means the skill will affect the target, even if it is magic immune.
loading_tip35					Look to see what skills are on cooldown from your team by highlighting their portraits top left.
loading_tip36					Your team will appreciate you more if you use high damage nukes early in fights rather than as finishers.
loading_tip37					You can see the gold, skills, health, and mana, of your allies at the top left of your screen. If you select their hero, you can see their items.
loading_tip38					Do not be afraid to lose. Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment. Everyone was new at one point.
loading_tip39					Be nice! A player will often ignore advice if you are screaming at them. Try saying it in a polite tone as a suggestion more than an order.
loading_tip40					Typing /gameinfo or /gi in-game will print a list of the current game options.
loading_tip41					Clicking on this hint box will display a new hint.
loading_tip42					Selecting a ^!yRegion^* and enabling the "Filter Pre-Query" checkbox on game browser interface will allow you to browse and refresh games faster.
loading_tip43					When a notification pops up in-game, you can ^gRIGHT ^gCLICK^* anywhere on it to close it rather than clicking the 'X' button.
loading_tip44					You can turn specific notifications on or off, or disable notifications in-game by clicking "Options" and then navigating to the "Interface" tab.
loading_tip45					Each team can only pause up to 3 times per game. Use them wisely!
loading_tip46					You can use the command /friendlychat or /fc to only accept messages from players in your clan or on your friend list.
loading_tip47					Typing /help will display a list of potentially useful commands available to you.

rap_0_title							Griefing
rap_0_tiptitle						What is Griefing?
rap_0_tiptxt						Feeding, avoiding AFK detection, ability and or item abuse. Item and/or courier spamming and destruction of items fall into this category.
rap_1_title							Chat Abuse
rap_1_tiptitle						What is Chat Abuse?
rap_1_tiptxt						Excessive profanities, racial slurs, or spamming.
rap_1_longtxt						Excessive profanities, racial slurs, or chat spam only. Spamming chat involves flooding the screen of other players with text or ASCII art 5 lines or less. Flaming or mockery regardless of skill level does not fall into this category.
rap_2_title							Other
rap_2_tiptitle						What falls into this category?
rap_2_tiptxt						Backdooring, leaving games, impersonating staff, and having a bad nickname.
rap_3_title							Feeding
rap_3_tiptitle						What is Feeding?
rap_3_tiptxt						Intentionally dying.
rap_3_longtxt						Players who play poorly and repeatedly die do not fall under this category, only those who have the intent to feed the opposing team. In most cases you will need written proof that the player is intentionally feeding.
rap_4_title							AFK Abuse
rap_4_tiptitle						What is Avoiding AFK Detection?
rap_4_tiptxt						Moving around to avoid being detected as AFK while not participating.
rap_4_longtxt						In this instance, the player will usually stay in the base, refusing to help, and only move when they are in danger of being marked AFK and getting kicked. If the player simply goes AFK and can be kicked, they are not avoiding AFK detection. 
rap_5_title							Ability/Item Abuse
rap_5_tiptitle						What is Ability/Item Abuse?
rap_5_tiptxt						Using items or spells to intentionally ruin the game.
rap_5_longtxt						Items or abilities such as Tablet of Command, Stormspirit, or Flux's "Magnetic Surge" that are constantly used on a teammate or yourself to ruin one's experience. Other instances can include a Behemoth constantly blocking players with Fissure, Succubus using Mesmerize on you, or a Blood Hunter using his silence ability on you.
rap_6_title							Item/Courier Spamming
rap_6_tiptitle						What is Item/Courier Spamming?
rap_6_tiptxt						Sending countless couriers to their death or wasting countless wards.
rap_6_longtxt						Buying all the wards in the game and placing them in the base, or selling all items and buying couriers to feed to the enemy would be examples of this.
rap_7_title							Item Destruction
rap_7_tiptitle						What is Item Destruction?
rap_7_tiptxt						Destroying one's items out of spite.
rap_7_longtxt						The destruction of a player's items with intent to upset others. Destroying items before disconnecting to spite your team is an example of this.
rap_8_title							Backdooring
rap_8_tiptitle						What is Backdooring?
rap_8_tiptxt						Attacking a tower without any creeps by it.
rap_8_longtxt						Backdooring is not against the code of conduct and is not a reportable action. It is a viable strategy and can be easily countered with a homecoming stone.
rap_9_title							Leaving the Game
rap_9_tiptitle						What is Leaving The Game?
rap_9_tiptxt						Leaving in the middle of games, also known as "Rage Quitting".
rap_9_longtxt						Simply leaving the game and not breaking any other rules does not warrant a suspension. The player already gains leave percentage. If he has broken a rule, please report him for that instead.
rap_10_title						Playing Poorly
rap_10_tiptitle						What is Playing Poorly?
rap_10_tiptxt						Not warding, dying a lot, and using skills ineffectively.

rap_12_tiptitle						What is Impersonating Staff?
rap_12_tiptxt						Impersonation of S2 or any volunteer position, including Moderators and Game Masters.
rap_12_longtxt						In this case, if a player claims to be a staff member or a Game Master and says he is going to suspend you, this would be a reportable offense.
rap_13_title						Bad Nickname
rap_13_tiptitle						What is a Bad Nickname?
rap_13_tiptxt						Offensive or sexually explicit names.
rap_13_longtxt						Offensive or sexually explicit names.
rap_14_title						Custom Report
rap_14_tiptitle						What is a Custom Report?
rap_14_tiptxt						Any offense that does not fit into one of the other categories.
rap_14_longtxt						You are about to submit a custom report. Please be sure to provide a detailed description of the abuse you believe to have occurred. This can include Stats Manipulation and Bug Exploitation.
rap_non_goback						None, Go Back
rap_non_goback_tip					None of these abuses occurred, go back to the previous screen.

rap_cooldown_period					Cooldown Period
rap_cooldown_period_tip				All reports have a 2 minute cooldown after the match is completed before it can be reported - the cooldown may vary up to ~5 minutes due to how match submissions and match duration calculations function. Please take this time to reflect on the match and assure that the actions of the player are reportable.
rap_cooldown_explanation			All reports have a 2 minute cooldown after the match is completed before it can be reported - the cooldown may vary up to ~5 minutes due to how match submissions and match duration calculations function. Please take this time to reflect on the match and assure that the actions of the player are reportable.
rap_nonevent_btn					Complete Incident Report
rap_nonevent_example				The following is an example of an invalid report:

rap_3_nonevent_title				You have opted to file a report for Intentional Feeding
rap_3_nonevent_deposit				Please note that the following are examples of ^ynon-reportable instances^* of Intentional Feeding. If you report any of these actions, your case will be closed and your ^ydeposit will be lost^*.
rap_3_nonevent_li_1					Player was playing poorly due to a lack of skill
rap_3_nonevent_li_2					Player died early game unintentionally
rap_3_nonevent_li_3					Player claims he is going to feed but never does
rap_3_nonevent_li_4					Player is under leveled and dies easily
rap_3_nonevent_li_5					Player has disconnected
rap_3_nonevent_detail				If a player is intentionally feeding it will be apparent in their behavior, usually by running down the lane to the enemies to die, over and over again. Players will often announce they are going to feed, however this isn't always the case. If a player begins to feed they will usually do it multiple times to ensure defeat. 
rap_3_nonevent_example				Player "1337honn3r" reports: "Offender went 2/6 mid and made us lose the game." This report was marked innocent because the offender did not intentionally feed. Although they may have failed during the lane-phase the offender was simply playing poorly.


rap_4_nonevent_title				You have opted to file a report for AFK Detection Abuse
rap_4_nonevent_deposit				Please note that the following are examples of ^ynon-reportable instances^* of AFK Detection Abuse. If you report any of these actions, your case will be closed and your ^ydeposit will be lost^*.
rap_4_nonevent_li_1					Player was kicked though and AFK vote
rap_4_nonevent_li_2					Player was marked AFK and was never kicked
rap_4_nonevent_li_3					Player went legitimately AFK, and game ended before player could be kicked
rap_4_nonevent_li_4					Player disconnected and never reconnected
rap_4_nonevent_li_5					You didn't like them
rap_4_nonevent_detail				AFK Detection is designed to allow allied players to remove an offender who has decided to quit playing the game. When kicked, this provides the remaining team members with a gold bonus and items, allowing them to better continue their game.
rap_4_nonevent_example				Player "1337honn3r" reports: "Offender went to the pool at level 4 and stayed there until the end of the game." This report was marked innocent because the offender sat in the well and did not move or cast spells. An AFK flag was raised, but he was never kicked.

rap_5_nonevent_title				You have opted to file a report for Ability/Item Abuse
rap_5_nonevent_deposit				Please note that the following are examples of ^ynon-reportable instances^* of Ability/Item Abuse. If you report any of these actions, your case will be closed and your ^ydeposit will be lost^*.
rap_5_nonevent_li_1					Player uses spells and abilities in attempt to save you from death
rap_5_nonevent_li_2					Player accidentally misses/targets an ability that affects you
rap_5_nonevent_li_3					Player chooses not to heal or use spells that may benefit you
rap_5_nonevent_detail				Ability and/or Item Abuse occurs when players attempt to disrupt teammates by using specific items or abilities. "No-Help" can be toggled by clicking the green circle next to their hero portrait, but is still a reportable offense if used to effect the outcome of the game.
rap_5_nonevent_example				Player "1337honn3r" reports: "While trying to escape, my ally used a tablet of command on me, and I accidentally got stuck in trees." This report was deemed innocent because the reported player was attempting to use his item for its intended purpose.

rap_6_nonevent_title				You have opted to file a report for Item/Courier Spamming
rap_6_nonevent_deposit				Please note that the following are examples of ^ynon-reportable instances^* of Item/Courier Spamming. If you report any of these actions, your case will be closed and your ^ydeposit will be lost^*.
rap_6_nonevent_li_1					Player allows the courier to be killed on accident and will not buy a new one.
rap_6_nonevent_li_2					Player buys all the wards, but places them appropriately
rap_6_nonevent_li_3					Player purchases items that may not be beneficial, but can't be lost when dropped
rap_6_nonevent_detail				If a player is mass purchasing items and/or couriers, they often hinder the team. Such examples of this include, but are not limited to: purchasing all the wards and placing them in base, buying a Bound Eye then sacrificing it to the other team, or buying multiple couriers and sending them to die.
rap_6_nonevent_example				Player "1337honn3r" reports: "Our ally bought wards but placed it so it couldn't see the rune spawn." This report was deemed innocent because the wards were placed to give vision of enemy heroes, despite the lack of knowledge the player had of warding spots.

rap_7_nonevent_title				You have opted to file a report for Item Destruction
rap_7_nonevent_deposit				Please note that the following are examples of ^ynon-reportable instances^* of Item Destruction. If you report any of these actions, your case will be closed and your ^ydeposit will be lost^*.
rap_7_nonevent_li_1					Courier dies while delivering items to a player
rap_7_nonevent_li_2					Player destroys items that cannot be sold, such as a Logger's Hatchet
rap_7_nonevent_li_3					Enemies destroying allied items that have been placed on the ground or falling from a courier
rap_7_nonevent_li_4					Destroying runes despite players being nearby
rap_7_nonevent_detail				Item Destruction can be reported when a player (and more often an ally) destroys items that could benefit you or the team. A common example is a player that destroys their own items before disconnecting, in order to leave the allied teammembers without any sort of compensation.
rap_7_nonevent_example				Player "1337honn3r" reports: "I was at the secret shop buying a Ward, but had to drop my Codex on the ground to do that. This enemy Night Hound attacked and destroyed my Codex." This report was deemed innocent because the reporter is at fault for dropping their item out in the open. If conditions are unsafe, it may be best to wait until you are back at base.

rap_1_nonevent_title				You have opted to file a report for Chat Abuse
rap_1_nonevent_deposit				Please note that the following are examples of ^ynon-reportable instances^* of Chat Abuse. If you report any of these actions, your case will be closed and your ^ydeposit will be lost^*.
rap_1_nonevent_li_1					You and the offender both insult each other
rap_1_nonevent_li_2					Player uses a few insults about you playing poorly
rap_1_nonevent_detail				If a player is verbally abusing you or teammates, do not respond to their insults. Players that fall into this category will often sling degrading and racially derogatory terms in hopes of hurting the other players on an emotional level. Furthermore ASCII characters 5 lines or under are not considered Chat Abuse.
rap_1_nonevent_example				Player "1337honn3r" reports: "Offender told me "Your momma so fat when Devourer hooks her he gets pulled in" and he called me an idiot." This report was marked innocent because the offender did not verbally harass the player to the point of wanting to emotionally harm him.

//Mailiken Honiversary Message
maliken_says1						Dear Friends & Fellow Gamers,
maliken_says2						I can't believe it has been 2 years since we officially launched our beloved game Heroes of Newerth. It has been an amazing journey so far... 
maliken_says3						We've had our share of mistakes and drama, but through it all HoN has achieved some great things. The single most important and notable accomplishment is a thriving, dedicated, and energetic community. While we are not all perfect (yes, I am including myself in that group as part of our community), we share one thing in common. We absolutely LOVE this game.
maliken_says4						Our time together has been great, but what excites me the most are the next years to come. Heroes of Newerth will never be done. We plan to support the game far into the future, and bring exciting new content and features that will consistently breathe new life into an already invigorating experience.
maliken_says5						Let me end this letter of appreciation with a standing ovation for all of you. Thank you for supporting our game, supporting our company, and supporting our lives. We love entertaining you all and look forward to the honor of doing it as long as we can. Now stop reading my ramblings and grab a few games of Mid Wars! Game HoN.
maliken_says6						Warmest Regards,
maliken_says7						Marc "Maliken" DeForest

maliken_says_sea1						Dear Friends & Fellow Gamers,
maliken_says_sea2						We can't believe it has been 1 year since we officially launched our beloved game Garena Heroes of Newerth. It has been an amazing journey so far...
maliken_says_sea3						One candle placed on a cake, one first birthday wish to make! Remember that playtime is never over, even as one gets older! As we grow to form an even bigger HoN family, weâ€™d like you to know that youâ€™ve made a significant impact to our lives. We thank you for your invaluable support, patience and most importantly, friendship, in contributing to where we are now and who we have become.
maliken_says_sea4						4 million heroes have shown their honour, strength, bravery and intelligence in the world of Newerth, hailing from places near and far, with Thai, Vietnamese and Indonesian heroes joining in the fray. Hundreds of thousands of battles happen every day, everywhere, with six hundred thousand heroes engaged in conflict each week, casting ripples which alter a battlefield that spans the entire SEA. Out of all this, we hope to bring the experience youâ€™ve been waiting for. In our efforts to be more community oriented, weâ€™ve been putting your voices as priority for the changes we make. Your support is our constant motivation.
maliken_says_sea5						With you with us, this marks beginning of a new era where games come to life. Weâ€™d like to thank you once more, for granting us this experience. We are now even more confident and dedicated to bringing more soul into Garena Heroes of Newerth.
maliken_says_sea6						Warmest Regards,
maliken_says_sea7						Garena HoN Team

// Recap Tips
hero_tip_disable_tips	Disable Tips

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Accursed_1			During Flame Consumption, place yourself in harm's way to heal more. Cauterize will also heal you.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Accursed_2			Use Fire Shield to remove debuffs and stuns from allies.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Accursed_1			Avoid damaging Accursed when he uses Flame Consumption. 
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Accursed_2			Back away from targets with Fire Shield before damaging them if possible.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Aluna_1				Pressing Deja Vu once gives Aluna a speed burst which can help to get away. Pressing it again can confuse enemies as to where you really are. The third time teleports you back to your image and disjoints any incoming projectiles.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Aluna_2				Remember that you can stop Power Throw mid cast if it looks like you won't hit it.  Order Stop is bound to "s" by default.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Aluna_1				Move erratically if you are expecting a charged Power Throw.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Aluna_2				Avoid standing next to the last creep in your wave to prevent Emerald Lighting from stunning you.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Ra_1				Path of Destruction allows you to move through terrain; use this to your advantage.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Ra_2				Consider not casting spells when you are already low on hit points.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Ra_1				Path of Destruction has a set range of 600. Move perpendicularly to avoid it.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Ra_2				Draining Amun-Ra's mana can reduce the effect of Pyroclasmic Rebirth after he dies.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Andromeda_1			Use Void Rip to swap positions with an unknowing enemy. Stun him to ensure an escape.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Andromeda_2			Aurora can be used to scout areas covered by fog of war.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Andromeda_1			Avoid Andromeda's Void Rip by staying behind allies or buying a Nullstone.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Andromeda_2			Andromeda is one of the most effective support gankers.  Be aware of where she is on the map.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Arachna_1			Try to activate Harden Carapace before you start taking damage. Support heroes and casters make easy prey for your Spider Sting.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Arachna_2			Harden Carapace can be saved to clear a specific debuffs such as Keeper of the Forest's Root.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Arachna_1			Aracha has no interrupting ability. Carry a Homecoming Stone and teleport out if you are in trouble.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Arachna_2			The Spider Sting's Spiderling can be killed if attacked four times.  It can be killed easily with help from a teammate.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Armadon_1			Try to anticipate enemy attacks and turn Armadon's back to them. By doing this Armordillo will cause more Spine Bursts to fire off and decrease incoming damage!
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Armadon_2			Try to save mana to use in a sustained battle where you can get multiple Spine Bursts off in a row on enemies.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Armadon_1			Keep track of Spine Burst stacks and back off if they are getting too high. Armadon deals the most damage in sustained battles.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Armadon_2			Armadon has no interrupting ability. Carry a Homecoming Stone and teleport out if you are in trouble.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Bephelgor_1			Running over corpses replenishes Balphagore's health. Although this is not much, it can often make the difference in a fight.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Bephelgor_2			Regurgitate can be used simply to heal and get charges for Corpse Conversion.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Bephelgor_1			Don't forget that Balphagore's minions do a lot of damage over time while putting a stacking slow on someone each time they hit.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Bephelgor_2			Items such as Shieldbreaker and Hellflower are great ways to help kill enemy tank heroes like Balphagore.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Behemoth_1			Try to use Fissure to stun and block off paths from assailants.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Behemoth_2			A clumped group of enemies makes easy prey for Shockwave. Buy a Portal Key to help you position yourself optimally.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Behemoth_1			When Shockwave is available, it is imperative to keep your team scattered. A clumped team will die almost instantly against a Behemoth.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Behemoth_2			Be aware of Behemoth's positioning and where he can Fissure to block you.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Blacksmith_1		Frenzy can be used for a movespeed buff to help get away from enemies. Using Fireball and Flaming Hammer can also slow enemies down.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Blacksmith_2		Time your Fireball to cast immediately after Flaming Hammer hits your target to maximize magic damage.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Blacksmith_1		Flaming Hammer lowers your magic armor, picking up some extra magic armor from Mystic Vestments or going for Shrunken Head can help prevent this.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Blacksmith_2		Nullstone is an effective counter to heroes with powerful single target spells such as Blacksmith.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Hunter_1			If being pursued, cast Hemorrhage to force them to take damage. If they lose too much health, you will gain movement speed from Blood Sense.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Hunter_2			Blood Crazy is one of the best silences in the game, but be careful about casting it on enemy heroes with high attack damage.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Hunter_1			Don't move while afflicted with Hemorrhage! Blood Hunter lacks an interrupt, so carry a Homecoming Stone and teleport out if necessary.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Hunter_2			Be careful not to get too low on hit points while killing neutral creeps against a team with Blood Hunter.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Bombardier_1		Use Bombardment to slow assailants. Sticky Bomb can also be used as a deterrent.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Bombardier_2		Heroes stop moving when they attack.  Use this period as an opportunity to drop a Sticky Bomb on them.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Bombardier_1		Stay away from allies and get in a safe position if you have Sticky Bomb on you.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Bombardier_2		Air Strike has global range, so be attentive and pick unusual paths to retreat when you're low on hit points.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Bubbles_1			Cast Shell Surf then Take Cover to become invulnerable before teleporting away.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Bubbles_2			A clumped group of enemies makes easy prey for Song of the Sea and Kelp Field. A Portal Key can help catch enemies clumped or help you escape after a Take Cover.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Bubbles_1			Pay attention to where Bubbles is Shell Surfing. Not doing so often leads to him porting to it afterwards to hit players with Song of the Sea and Kelp Field.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Bubbles_2			It's important to stay scattered to avoid Song of the Sea and Kelp Field when you anticipate a team fight against Bubbles.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Chipper_1			Quickly cast Rocket Barrage on assailants to mini-stun and slow them down. If they come too close, Tar Toss to slow them further.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Chipper_2			If you're having trouble hitting Rocket Barrage, try saving it for when the enemy is closer, mid attack animation, or is immobilized.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Chipper_1			Stay out of Sawblade Showdown! If hit by Tar Toss, try to move erratically to dodge an incoming Rocket Barrage.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Chipper_2			Chipper does large amounts of magic damage, picking up some extra magic armor from Mystic Vestments or going for Shrunken Head can help prevent this.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Chronos_1			Time Leap should either be used as initiation, leading into Chronofield, or saved as an escape.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Chronos_2			Position Chronofield so that you catch enemies on the close edge in order to allow friendly melee units to help attack them.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Chronos_1			Kill Chronos early and often to prevent him from farming. A late game Chronos should be focused relentlessly.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Chronos_2			It's important to stay scattered to avoid Chronofield when you anticipate a team fight against Chronos.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_CorruptedDisciple_1	Cast Corrupted Conduit on an assailant to drain his damage. Use your superior movement speed to escape, or simply turn on him for a kill once you've drained his damage.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_CorruptedDisciple_2	Corrupted Disciple does well in sustained battles where he can stack up Corrupted Conduit and keep Overload hitting enemies. Protective items can help battles become prolonged.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_CorruptedDisciple_1	Corrupted Conduit lowers your damage while increasing Corrupted Disciple's and giving him vision of the target! Avoid this by running 700 or more units away from Corrupted.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_CorruptedDisciple_2	Keep track of how long Corrupted Disciple has had Corrupted Conduit on.  Corrupted Disciple can do devastating damage if he has a high stack of Corrupted Conduit.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Cthulhuphant_1		The damage reduction from Hook'em only applies if enemies hit Cthulhuphant in the front. Trample can also be used as a way to escape from enemies.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Cthulhuphant_2		Trample through creeps to help ensure a stun and deal extra damage.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Cthulhuphant_1		Trample pushes creeps in front of Cthulhuphant dealing extra damage and stunning; avoiding creeps between Cthulhuphant and you can often allow you to dodge the trample completely.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Cthulhuphant_2		Deal damage from behind to avoid Cthulhuphant's Hook'em shield.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Dampeer_1			Vampiric Flight and Consume can be used to regain hit points quickly. Fighting is sometimes the solution to surviving!
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Dampeer_2			Queue up spells while using Vampiric Flight. Queuing can be done by holding "Shift" by default.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Dampeer_1			Buy Magic Armor to mitigate Dampeer's spell damage.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Dampeer_2			Ganking Dampeer will shut down his ganking potential for a couple of minutes while he has to regain Essences to be effective.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Vanya_1				Cast Cover of Darkness to blind enemies, then use Charging Strikes to escape.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Vanya_2				Taint Soul can be used as an effective last hitting tool when getting in melee range isn't an option.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Vanya_1				Avoid Dark Lady when she has Dark Blades activated. She is much more vulnerable without them!
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Vanya_2				Kill Dark Lady early and often to prevent her from farming. A late game Dark Lady should be focused relentlessly.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Deadwood_1			Activate Clearcutting and head straight for the trees when in trouble. Your opponents will lose sight of you.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Deadwood_2			Rotten Grasp can make Willowmaker do extra damage by reducing enemy armor.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Deadwood_1			Buy copious amounts of armor to prevent Willowmaker from blasting you away.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Deadwood_2			Vision from Wards of Sight and good movement speed can be the best way to avoid a Rotten Grasp and Willowmaker combo completely.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Defiler_1			Activate Unholy Expulsion and attack a single target to quickly bring him down. Buy protective items, as your primary source of damage output comes from using Unholy Expulsion and keeping yourself alive!
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Defiler_2			Wave of Death has a short cooldown and can be cast at considerable range affecting multiple enemies at once. Position and mobility are key for lining up your enemies.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Defiler_1			Never take on Defiler one-on-one when she has Unholy Expulsion activated. Be mindful of your health when fighting her; when the ghosts start swooping in, you're going to be in trouble.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Defiler_2			Wave of Death has a very long range. Move perpendicularly to avoid it.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Shaman_1			Cast Unbreakable on yourself when you're at low health. Any instance of lethal damage will heal you instead!
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Shaman_2			Try to kite enemy heroes into your friendly creep wave and then cast Healing Wave for a devastating effect.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Shaman_1			Lethal damage will heal Demented Shaman when he has Unbreakable activated. A small amount of armor will go a long way to mitigating the effects of Storm Cloud!
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Shaman_2			Avoid standing in the enemy creep wave to prevent taking up to 700 physical damage from a Healing Wave.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Devourer_1			Intermittently turn Decay on and off to slow and damage assailants. If they lack an interrupt, Devour one of them to cause a large health swing before continuing to escape or turning on them for a kill.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Devourer_2			Buying magic armor such as Mystic Vestments or Shaman's Headdress will help you take less damage from your own Decay.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Devourer_1			Interrupt Devourer as soon as he begins to Devour.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Devourer_2			Move erratically and stay behind allied creeps to avoid being grabbed by Guttling Hook.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_DoctorRepulsor_1	You can use abilities and items while moving with Ludicrous Speed.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_DoctorRepulsor_2	Keep a high mana pool to ensure you can get into and out of a fight with Ludicrous Speed when needed.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_DoctorRepulsor_1	Make good use of crowd control when fighting Dr. Repulsor. He doesn't have much burst damage, but his sustained damage and mobility can get out of control if you don't kill him early.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_DoctorRepulsor_2	Hellflower and other silencing effects are very effective at shutting down Doctor Repulsor.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_DrunkenMaster_1		Drink passively boosts your other abilities as long as charges are in reserve. Activating Drink will drain your reserve charges and replenish some life.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_DrunkenMaster_2		Use Stagger to disjoint incoming spells and attacks when in trouble.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_DrunkenMaster_1		Avoid casting targeted spells on Drunken Master while Untouchable is activated.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_DrunkenMaster_2		Drunken Master deals a lot of physical damage, so buying armor will help to mitigate his usefulness.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Electrician_1		When escaping, activate Electric Shield as often as possible to mitigate incoming damage. Use Cleansing Shock on yourself to boost your own speed.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Electrician_2		Try to use Static Grip after the enemy team has used it's disable spells or on the hero with the last unused disable in order to get a long-duration Static Grip.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Electrician_1		Stay close to an allied disabler to prevent long-duration Static Grips.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Electrician_2		Electrician is highly reliant on Electric Shield to deal damage, so reduce his mana by attacking him while it's up or burning his mana.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_EmeraldWarden_1		Emerald Warden has very high sustained damage. Try to stay hidden behind allies and unleash your spells from a safe distance.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_EmeraldWarden_2		Set Overgrowth's near your tower to punish overaggressive enemies or use them for vision to avoid ganks.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_EmeraldWarden_1		Hunter's Command has huge range and does not require sight. Retreat early to avoid an untimely death.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_EmeraldWarden_2		Overgrowths can be destroyed with 1-2 attacks if you get trapped in them.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Empath_1			A well-placed Illusory Veil can be the difference between life or death. You can also dodge incoming damage by jumping into an ally with As One.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Empath_2			If Essence link is about to expire anyway, break it by moving away for the extra stun.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Empath_1			Quickly focus down Empath before she's able to enter an ally with As One. If she successfully combines, kill her target to cause her to pop out. Empath is very vulnerable alone.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Empath_2			Break Essence Link early or not at all to avoid taking both the damage and the stun.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Engineer_1			Try to land The Keg on yourself and pursuing enemies to stun them while building distance. Unleashing Energy Field can slow surrounding enemies to a crawl.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Engineer_2			Knock back targets trying to run out of Energy Field with The Keg.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Engineer_1			Attack the Engineer's gadgets to prevent them from dealing too much damage. Be wary of being led into Spider Mine traps.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Engineer_2			Be aware of Engineer's mana and position to get an idea when and where he's placing Spider Mines.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Fayde_1				Use Burning Shadows to stun assailants. While using Reflection, be mindful of enemies that are carrying stealth detection.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Fayde_2				Use the treewalking of Reflection to surprise enemies that have stealth detection.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Fayde_1				Keep good map awareness and buy Ward of Revelations to prevent Fayde from taking you by surprise.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Fayde_2				Buy hit point items such as Fortified Bracers and magic armor such as Mystic Vestments to keep Fayde from killing you with her burst magic damage.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_FlintBeastwood_1	Flint Beastwood is best played in the back lines of a fight dealing damage from afar while his teammates occupy the enemy team.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_FlintBeastwood_2	Explosive Flare does damage to buildings and can be used to finish off towers enemies are trying to deny.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_FlintBeastwood_1	Flint Beastwood does very good damage from a long distance, but has little ways to escape if you get close to him.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_FlintBeastwood_2	Look to gank Flint Beastwood early and often.  He is an easy target without an escape and he scales very well into late game if allowed to farm.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Flux_1				Activate Discharge while in purple mode to push all enemies away.  Building strength on Flux not only increases his survivability, but increases the damage of Magnetic Surge.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Flux_2				Discharge can be used to reveal stealthed enemy heroes that would otherwise get away.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Flux_1				A Nullstone will protect you from a global Discharge.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Flux_2				Scatter from your teammates fast after a Discharge because it's usually followed up by many area of effect spells.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_ForsakenArcher_1	When escaping, predict your opponents' movements with Crippling Volley.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_ForsakenArcher_2	Save up the Call of the Damned skeletal minions for when you can push a tower or get into a fight. Click the ability to start stacking the minions and click it again to unleash them.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_ForsakenArcher_1	Piercing Arrows is cast from an illusion, but it can still be interrupted by a stun or silence.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_ForsakenArcher_2	Move erratically when you expect a Crippling Volley.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Gauntlet_1			Cast Grapple on an ally to move both him and yourself out of harm's way.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Gauntlet_2			Grapple can be used to hook in a hero or push both of you forward depending on how far you cast it.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Gauntlet_1			A Nullstone will protect you from Gauntlet Blast. Gauntlet's damage output is all magic damage, so buy magic armor to mitigate its effects.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Gauntlet_2			Be aware of Gauntlet's positioning to avoid being hooked or pushed into his tower range.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Geomancer_1			Use Dig to travel through unpathable terrain like cliffs and trees. Both Quicksand and Crystal Field can not only be placed on top of enemies, but in front of them as a deterrent.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Geomancer_2			You can cast spells while traveling underground with Dig.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Geomancer_1			When Crystal Field is placed, quickly move out of the way before it blows.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Geomancer_2			The pulsing damage from Earth's Grasp can be avoided if you can move fast enough. Marchers will help keep you ahead of them.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Frosty_1			Use Ice Imprisonment to shut down an assailant. You can also cast Ice Imprisonment on yourself to mitigate damage for the duration, then cast Glacial Downpour to slow and damage nearby enemies.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Frosty_2			Use Tundra Blast as Ice Imprisonment fades to avoid overlapping your disabling effects.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Frosty_1			Glacial Downpour is one of the most damaging spells in the game. Quickly interrupt him if he channels it.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Frosty_2			You can still cast spells while under the effect of Ice Imprisonment.

hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Gladiator_1			Try to position Pitfall to predict your opponent's movements.
hero_tip_offensive_tip_Hero_Gladiator_2			Positioning is important for maximizing the number of enemies hit by Flagellation.  An Assassin Shroud can help you position as well as give a damage boost to the Flagellation attack.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Gladiator_1			Move perpendicular to Gladiator to avoid being caught in Flagellation's radius.
hero_tip_defensive_tip_Hero_Gladiator_2			Gladiator's spells have a long delay, so move erratically to avoid them.

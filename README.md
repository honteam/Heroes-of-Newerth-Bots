Heroes-of-Newerth-Bots
======================

This is the code repository for Heroes of Newerth's open-source bot code. This repo is for better communication and codeflow between the community, the Community Bot Team, and S2 Games.

How to Submit a Bot
===================

1. [Fork](https://github.com/s2games/Heroes-of-Newerth-Bots/fork) this repository
2. Create a new branch based off the Community branch. We recommend against making changes directly to any existing branches. We also recommend naming your branch based on a combination of your username and the project name.
3. Develop and add files to this new branch. (Do not remove any files that are not supposed to be removed by your changes.)
4. Please add only files relevant to this bot (or library) on this branch. Do not add changes that are irrelevant to this specific development to this branch. It will slow down the submission process and may cause your submission to be rejected.
5. On your bot branch on github, click 'Pull Request'. Make sure the pull request is aimed at the 'Heroes-of-Newerth-Bots Community' branch, not the Retail branch., and not a branch named the same as your branch. Double check your files and changes, and provide some commentary if needed.
6. Comments and suggestions will be made. Simply commit any relevant changes to this same branch to add those changes to the pull request.
7. Once your changes are accepted by a Bot team member, your changes will be added to the Community branch, and eventually moved into the Dev and Retail branches.
 
Here is how code will flow between the branches:
